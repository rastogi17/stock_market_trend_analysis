Our platform is a comprehensive solution designed to empower investors with a wide array of analytical tools which is at this stage tailored specifically for NIFTY 50 listed companies. We employ cutting-edge technologies and methodologies to deliver unparalleled insights into stock trends and market dynamics.

Utilizing sentiment analysis, we meticulously analyze a curated selection of the latest news articles relevant to each stock. Despite constraints on data availability, we ensure a robust analysis by examining the sentiment of the last 100 news articles published for the same date. This approach provides users with real-time insights into market sentiment surrounding specific stocks, enabling informed decision-making.

In addition to sentiment analysis, we leverage LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models for both single-variable (closing price) and multivariate (RSI, OBV, Close, Open, High, Low, Volume) analysis of stock prices. Unlike traditional models trained on historical data, our LSTM models are live-trained using real-time data up until the previous trading day. This ensures that our predictions are continuously updated to reflect the latest market conditions, allowing us to forecast stock trends with a horizon extending up to 60 days into the future.

Our platform also integrates FB Prophet, metaâ€™s powerful forecasting tool, to provide long-term analysis based on seasonal trends and its ability to recognize patterns in data. Thus we opted for this to enable users to gain insights into broader market trends and potential future price movements, enhancing their strategic investment decisions.

For comparative analysis, we offer a feature that allows users to compare key metrics between companies within the same sector. By selecting the relevant tickers and metrics (such as close, open, high, etc.), users can quickly assess the relative performance of different stocks, facilitating benchmarking and portfolio optimization.

Furthermore, our platform includes candlestick chart analysis, a widely used technique for visualizing market data and tracking price movements. This intuitive tool provides users with valuable insights into market trends, patterns, and potential trading opportunities.

To complement our quantitative analysis, we employ web scraping to gather fundamental metrics, providing users with essential data points for evaluating investment opportunities. From financial statements to key performance indicators, our platform offers a comprehensive overview of each company's fundamentals, enabling users to make well-informed investment decisions.

With these integrated components, our platform offers a holistic approach to stock analysis, combining advanced technologies, real-time data, and user-friendly interfaces to empower investors with actionable insights and decision support.
